Multi-layered Abstraction: MARCO creates multiple layers of abstraction from the input documents, starting from the most general concepts and progressively becoming more specific. This hierarchical structure enables efficient processing and retrieval of information, even as the number of documents grows.

Efficient Information Retrieval: The system employs advanced retrieval mechanisms, such as cosine similarity, TF-IDF weighting, and vector embeddings, to quickly identify the most relevant documents or passages based on a given query. MARCO optimizes the retrieval process to handle large-scale datasets and provide fast response times.

Contextual Answer Generation: MARCO generates answers that are contextually relevant to the given query and the retrieved information. By leveraging the multi-layered abstraction and the retrieved documents, the system synthesizes coherent and accurate answers, taking into account factors like relevance scores, topic coverage, and the relationships between different pieces of information.

Iterative Refinement and Satisfaction Assessment: The system incorporates an iterative refinement mechanism to improve the quality and relevance of the generated answers. MARCO assesses the satisfaction level of the retrieved information and the generated answer based on predefined criteria, such as relevance scores and topic coverage. If the satisfaction threshold is not met, the system dynamically expands the search to neighboring abstraction layers or performs focused searches to gather more relevant information.

Adaptability and Scalability: MARCO is designed to handle dynamic addition or removal of documents from the corpus without requiring extensive retraining. The system adapts to changes in the document collection and updates its internal representations and indices accordingly. The architecture is scalable and can accommodate large-scale datasets, supporting efficient processing and retrieval.
