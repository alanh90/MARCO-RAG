## Introduction

The Infinite-Context Project is an open-source initiative aimed at enhancing how language models process and retrieve information from extensive text datasets. By introducing a novel, multilayered summary indexing system, this project seeks to significantly improve the efficiency of language models, enabling them to handle large-scale texts. Mimicking the hierarchical structure of human memory for information recall, the Infinite-Context system presents a pioneering solution for comprehensive database analysis and interaction.

## Features

- **Multilayered Summary Index**: Implements a three-tiered approach to data summarization and indexing, facilitating rapid information retrieval.
- **Compatibility**: Designed to be compatible with any language model, with initial development and testing conducted using GPT-3.5.
- **Advanced Search Capabilities**: Integrates keyword summary indexing with vector embedding search techniques for nuanced data retrieval.
- **Open-Source**: Encourages community involvement and contributions, fostering an environment of continuous improvement and innovation.
